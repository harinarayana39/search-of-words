Search-of-Words

. Searching a word in document is a very critical task in the case when the document is of very large size.
. It takes a lot of time and itâ€™s not flexible, in order to make the task easier this project is developed.
. In this project, we are able to search a word such that we can get all the documents which consist of that word.
. Consider an example, if you want to find a question in a set of previous papers we have to search every question in every paper.
. Which is not a simpler task in order to reduce this complexity we are using Global Search of Words.
. So that we can get all the documents which consists of that word without referring to a single document.
